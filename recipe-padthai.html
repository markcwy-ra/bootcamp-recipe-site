    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Follow the package instructions to boil the dry rice noodles. The rice
        noodles should be soft (but still chewy and not mushy) after boiling.
        Rinse the boiled noodles with cold running water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix all the ingredients in the Pad Thai Sauce in a small bowl until well
        combined and the sugar completely dissolved, set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat up a skillet on high heat and add the oil. As soon as the oil is
        heated, add the garlic into the skillet and start stirring until you
        smell the aroma of the garlic. Add the shrimp and the tofu pieces into
        the skillet and continue stirring.
      </li>
      <li>
        As soon as the shrimp changes color, add the noodles into the skillet
        and stir continuously, about 30 seconds. Use the spatula to push the
        noodles to one side of the skillet, and crack the egg on the empty side
        of the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the spatula to break the egg yolk and blend with the egg white, let
        cook for about 30 seconds. Combine the egg and the noodles, and add the
        Seasoning sauce. Stir to combine well with the noodles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, add the bean sprouts and chives and continue stirring. As soon as
        the bean sprouts are cooked, stir-in the crushed peanut. Turn off the
        heat and serve the Pad Thai immediately with the lime wedges.
      </li>
    </ol>
